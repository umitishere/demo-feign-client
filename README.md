First, download and run demo-service Spring Boot project here [https://github.com/umitishere/demo-service](https://github.com/umitishere/demo-service)

Also run this project and make sure it works when you visit:

* http://localhost:8086/demo/user-id
* http://localhost:8086/demo/user-name
* http://localhost:8086/demo/user-email

Port numbers have been set in src/main/resources/application.properties file:

* Example: server.port = 8086

In the other project which is demo-service, we've set the port as 8084
